# Welcome 👋

I'm someone who loves building ideas and sharing them freely.  
I believe in **open-source software**, community-driven development, and creative freedom.  
This space is for connecting with others who feel the same.

## 💡 Who Am I?

I'm a developer and thinker with a passion for open-source.  
I come up with ideas — tools, libraries, full systems — and I want to bring them to life **with people who care about quality, openness, and innovation**.

I'm not a company. I'm not a startup.  
I'm just someone who wants to **build cool things**, together.

## 🚀 What I'm Building

I’m working on several open projects, including:

- Linux-based operating systems  
- Qt-based desktop environments  
- Developer tools and libraries  
- Apps for macOS, iOS, Android, and Windows  
- Documentation sites and knowledge tools

And I’m looking for people to **join the journey**.
